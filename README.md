# probDistCalculator

**probDistCalculator** is a Java-based utility designed to solve Probability Distribution problems. The program takes user input for the mean and number of trials and is capable of solving problems for several key distributions, including Binomial, Geometric, Poisson, and Normal distributions, commonly encountered in courses such as **Math 180A**. The program is designed to be mistake-proof, meaning it will guide users to the correct solution by offering feedback and corrections along the way.

## Features

- **Distribution Support**: Solves problems involving the following probability distributions:
  - Binomial Distribution
  - Geometric Distribution
  - Poisson Distribution
  - Normal Distribution
- **Interactive Input**: Asks the user for the necessary inputs (e.g., mean, number of trials) to compute solutions for the specified distribution.
- **Mistake-Proof Design**: If an incorrect input is provided, the program will guide the user by providing corrections and instructions to achieve the correct solution.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The program requests the user to input the mean and number of trials for the problem.
2. **Distribution Selection**: The program solves for the specified probability distribution based on the provided data.
3. **Correction Mechanism**: If the input is invalid or incorrect, the program provides feedback, corrects the error, and assists the user in reaching the correct answer.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/probDistCalculator.git
